Must restart session (log out and log back in) to make windrbd
drive visible in Explorer (it is visible in cmd and cygwin shell
rightaway).

Flush requests are not propagated to backing device.

Auto-promote is not supported.

Right now only NTFS is supported atop the windrbd device.

System Volume (C:) cannot be used for windrbd.
