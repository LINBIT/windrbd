Neccessary steps:

Install WinDRBD Bus driver
	Device manager: add legacy hardware: windrbd.inf

Install WinDRBD Disk driver
	(else will not call START_DEVICE PnP request)
	To do so install windrbd with boot device and wait for
	primary disabled and do Update driver software in
	device manager (windrbd-disk.inf).

	Do a drbdadm up of a dummy device (does not need to
	have backing storage or connection)

	TODO: Maybe it is also possible to just doubleclick the
	inf file which makes things far more easier.

Install windrbd driver with boot and wait for primary in
	windrbd I/O requests (not windrbd_pnp, but windrbd_create)

Also: Disable UDP logging (NO_NET_PRINTK) in printk-to-syslog

Enable NIC driver
	E1 something for my VirtualBox

Enable AFD driver (unclear if really needed)

Enable Broadcom drivers (unclear if really needed)

Currently: Assign a fixed IP address (must match the one in DRBD
	config). TODO: which driver to load on boot to make
	DHCP work?

Also Disable Network Discovery (else there is a short time gap
	in which network is down and Windows needs to access
	boot device in order to continue):

	(from https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/675520ed-fe25-455e-a86e-fdb833903b10/windows-takes-an-exceptionally-long-time-to-establish-a-network-connection-after-booting

	Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Center\Advanced sharing settings

	Turn OFF network discovery

Disable NDIS lightweight filter for boot NIC:

	Not clear if that really helps .. still there is a 90 seconds
	(at least) delay.
