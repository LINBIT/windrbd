Neccessary steps:

Install WinDRBD Bus driver
	Device manager: add legacy hardware: windrbd.inf

Install WinDRBD Disk driver
	(else will not call START_DEVICE PnP request)
	To do so install windrbd with boot device and wait for
	primary disabled and do Update driver software in
	device manager (windrbd-disk.inf).

	Do a drbdadm up of a dummy device (does not need to
	have backing storage or connection)

	TODO: Maybe it is also possible to just doubleclick the
	inf file which makes things far more easier.

Install windrbd driver with boot and wait for primary in
	START_DEVICE enabled.

Enable NIC driver
	E1 something for my VirtualBox

Enable AFD driver

More drivers? We currently do not get network.
