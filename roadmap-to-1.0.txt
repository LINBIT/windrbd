Roadmap to 1.0
--------------

Currently working on Installer (WinPE)

Rework boot URL syntax
        Also have more than one DRBD node
        Also can specify syslog_ip.

Make fcgi script for serving boot device
        With keep-alive

Make reestablish connection work

Make hang on shutdown work
        Reason is swap in from pagefile when there is no more network

Allow whole disk as WinDRBD device (mount as drive): 0.9.2 compat
        And revert behaviour of creating device only on becoming Primary

inno-setup: fix creation of bus device

Make DHCP on boot device work
        right now, need to configure a static address

Netboot flag
        So we don't have to patch the registry

stability fixes
        For example, BSOD on running unattendend.
