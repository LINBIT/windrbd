Roadmap to 1.0
--------------

Installer (WinPE)

Rework boot URL syntax
        Also have more than one DRBD node
        Also can specify syslog_ip.

Don't require configuring the WinDRBD bus device

(inno-setup: fix creation of bus device)
	if needed

Make fcgi script for serving boot device
        With keep-alive

Make reestablish connection work

Make hang on shutdown work
        Reason is swap in from pagefile when there is no more network

stability fixes
        For example, BSOD on running unattendend.

----

Done:

0.10.1: Allow whole disk as WinDRBD device (mount as drive): 0.9.2 compat
        And revert behaviour of creating device only on becoming Primary

0.10.2: Make DHCP on boot device work
        right now, need to configure a static address

0.10.2: Netboot flag
        So we don't have to patch the registry
