Roadmap to 1.0

Roadmap to 1.1:

Installer (WinPE)

Make reestablish connection work

Make hang on shutdown work
        Reason is swap in from pagefile (or executable, hangs also
	when pagefile is disabled) when there is no more network

----

Done:

0.10.1: Allow whole disk as WinDRBD device (mount as drive): 0.9.2 compat
        And revert behaviour of creating device only on becoming Primary

0.10.2: Make DHCP on boot device work
        right now, need to configure a static address

0.10.2: Netboot flag
        So we don't have to patch the registry

0.10.4: stability fixes
        For example, BSOD on running unattendend.

0.10.5: Rework boot URL syntax
        Also have more than one DRBD node
        Also can specify syslog_ip.

0.10.6: Upgrade DRBD to 9.0.22

0.10.7: inno-setup: fix creation of bus device
	Done. Need to get feedback from users if that breaks
	things.

----

Rejected:

Make fcgi script for serving boot device
        With keep-alive

Don't require configuring the WinDRBD bus device
	This is done by the installer now.
