#!/bin/bash
#
# Copyright (c) 2007 LINBIT Information Technologies GmbH
# Based on the original "block" VBD script by XenSource Inc.
#
# This script implements the "drbd" VBD type. To use a DRBD resource
# as a virtual block device, include a line similar to this in your
# domU configuration:
#
# disk = [ 'drbd:myresource,xvda1,w' ]
#
# This will direct Xen to put the DRBD resource named 'myresource'
# into the Primary role, and configure it as device xvda1 in your
# domU. You may use as many DRBD resources as you like. If you are
# using DRBD in dual-Primary mode (available in DRBD versions 8.0 and
# up), your DRBD-backed domU will be live migration capable. 
#
# IMPORTANT: If you run DRBD in dual-Primary mode with Xen, you MUST
#            ensure that the only time the resource is accessed by
#            both nodes is during domain migration. If you fire up a
#            DRBD-backed domU simultaneously on two nodes, you WILL
#            wreck your VBD data. DO NOT attempt to set up a live
#            migration capable, DRBD-backed domU unless you
#            understand these implications.
#
# This script will not load the DRBD kernel module for you, nor will
# it attach, detach, connect, or disconnect your resource. The init
# script distributed with DRBD will do that for you. Make sure it is
# started before attempting to start a DRBD-backed domU.
#
# Known limitations:
#
# - With 'file' and 'phy' VBD's, Xen will allow one block device to be
#   made available read-only to multiple domU's, or be mounted
#   read-only in the dom0 and be made available read-only to
#   domU's. This is not supported by the 'drbd' VBD type.
# - Tested, thus far, only on Debian etch with Xen 3.0.3.
