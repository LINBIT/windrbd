What is WinDRBD?
================

WinDRBD is a port of Linbit's Distributed Replicated Block Device
(DRBD) Linux driver to Microsoft Windows. It is wire-compatible
with the Linux version and supports almost all features of the
Linux version, too.

DRBD itself is used to build High Availability clusters by replicating
contents of one block device over a network to (up to 31) other nodes.

In order to get professional support for WinDRBD please contact
sales@linbit.com directly.

To learn how to use WinDRBD to create a 2-node HA cluster based
on Microsoft Windows, or to learn how to use WinDRBD for booting
Windows from a Linux server please go to https://downloads.linbit.com
and download the WinDRBD tech guides. You might also find the
articles on https://kb.linbit.com useful.

Since release 1.0.0, WinDRBD can be used in production environments
for HA setups (as data disks). Support for system volume ("C:")
replication and booting from a WinDRBD server is still experimental,
since it is difficult to set up and cannot currently recover from
a network outage.

WinDRBD is Open Source and licensed under the GNU general public
license. To obtain the source code, please go to:

We'd love to get feedback, either over the github site or over
the DRBD user mailing list (drbd-user@lists.linbit.com, please
go to http://lists.linbit.com/mailman/listinfo/drbd-user to
subscribe).

Thank you for participating in WinDRBD development by using it.
