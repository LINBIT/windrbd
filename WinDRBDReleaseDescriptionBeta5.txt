This is release 0.9.0-beta5 of windrbd.

It is distributed in order to get feedback from testers, please email
bug reports directly to johannes@johannesthoma.com

We are of course also interested in:

	*) What works for you

	*) Performance numbers

	*) What else is on your wishlist (see restrictions)

	*) Which systems you used for testing

In order to get professional support for windrbd please contact
sales@linbit.com directly.

What currently works is:

	*) Connection between Linux/Windows or Windows/Windows

	*) NTFS and RAW backing devices

	*) Most drbdadm and drbdsetup commands (including drbdsetup
	   events2).

	*) Internal or External metadata

	*) Many DRBD features like syncing, protocol A, B and C
	   on-line replication and diskless primary

	*) 3 node setups work but haven't been tested a lot. In
	   theory n-node setups (n<=32) should work.

	*) Proper install / uninstallation of package (no reboot neccessary
	   on install, however reboot neccessary on uninstall).

For a more complete listing of current implementation status, please
refer to the files FEATURES and CURRENT-LIMITATIONS in the git repo.

We have tested under following operating systems:

	*) Windows 7 (running in a VirtualBox VM)

	*) Windows 10 (physical machine)

	*) Windows Server 2016 (running in a libvirt VM (kvm))

	*) Linux (Ubuntu)

Here are restrictions we know of for the 1.0 release:

	*) Auto-promote is not supported.

	*) System Volume (C:) cannot be used for windrbd.

	*) Windows applications that use undocumented ioctl
	   system calls (like winsat).

Getting started:

	Please refer to the users guide to learn about configuring
	WinDRBD to connect a DRBD resource replicated between
	two Windows Server 2016 machines.

Thank you for participating in windrbd development.
