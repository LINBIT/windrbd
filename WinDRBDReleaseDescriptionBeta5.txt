This is release 0.9.0-beta5 of windrbd.

It is distributed in order to get feedback from testers, please email
bug reports directly to johannes@johannesthoma.com

We are of course also interested in:

	*) What works for you

	*) Performance numbers

	*) What else is on your wishlist (see restrictions)

	*) Which systems you used for testing

In order to get professional support for windrbd please contact
sales@linbit.com directly.

What currently works is:

	*) Connection between Linux/Windows or Windows/Windows

	*) NTFS and RAW backing devices

	*) Most drbdadm and drbdsetup commands.

	*) Internal or External metadata

	*) Many DRBD features like syncing, protocol A, B and C
	   on-line replication and diskless primary

	*) 3 node setups work but haven't been tested a lot. In
	   theory n-node setups (n<=32) should work.

	*) Proper install / uninstallation of package (no reboot neccessary
	   on install, however reboot neccessary on uninstall).

Things that are known to be broken are:

	*) On backing device failure with ongoing I/O there are blue
	   screens (see TODO file in repo for more details).

	*) Network failure on n-node setups with m connected nodes (m>2)
	   setups.

	*) File systems other than NTFS

Further notes:

	*) Older cygwin installations (2016 and older, use uname -a
	   to find the date) have problems starting programs with
           whitespace in path names (at least when called via the
	   PATH environment variable). If you have such a cygwin
	   installation please update it by running the setup
           program from https://cygwin.com/install.html .
	   (Note that WinDRBD comes with a cygwin1.dll bundled,
           so you can also run WinDRBD commands from a cmd shell)

	*) On Uninstall sometimes Windows displays Installation failed
	   while it didn't. You can ignore this message.

	   Reboot the machine to remove the driver from memory.

	*) The path for the DRBD configuration is currently hardcoded
	   in the binaries to C:\windrbd (your DRBD configuration
	   directory is C:\windrbd\etc\drbd.d). This may change in
	   the future, suggestions where to put it are welcome.

We have tested under following operating systems:

	*) Windows 7 (running in a VirtualBox VM)

	*) Windows 10 (physical machine)

	*) Windows Server 2016 (running in a libvirt VM (kvm))

	*) Linux (Ubuntu)

Here are restrictions we know of for the 1.0 release:

	*) Auto-promote is not supported.

	*) System Volume (C:) cannot be used for windrbd.

	*) No 32-Bit version is supported, only 64 bit.
	   If you require 32-Bit support, please contact Linbit.

	*) Windows 7 is minimum (no Vista, no XP)

	*) Windows applications that use undocumented ioctl
	   system calls (like winsat).

Getting started:

	*) Make a snapshot of your Windows System (either using
           your favorite VM enviroment or something like CloneZilla).

	*) Run the install-windrbd-signed-0.8.0-beta4.exe file from the
	   Linbit Website as Administrator.

	*) You'll find the windrbd configuration files in the folder

	C:\windrbd\etc\drbd.d

	(note that they use the UNIX end-of-line character, you should
	 keep that).

        *) Start logging by following command (as Administrator):

	   windrbd log-server <filename>

	   Will log to the cmd window and to the file filename.
	   (note: to log via network change the ipaddress in the
	   registry:

Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\drbd\syslog_ip

           and reboot).

	   The target must either run windrbd log-server or be a
	   Linux host with UDP logging activated (see file INSTALL).
	   If it is a Linux host log messages usually go to
	   /var/log/syslog

	*) Create an empty partition using Control Panel (System/
	   Administration/Create and Format Partitions).
	   Do not format this partition, since it will be used as
	   backing device.

	*) You may assign a drive letter to the partition, however
	   we recommend not to do that and instead use the GUID of
           the partition. Use mountvol utility to find that GUID.

	*) Adapt the windrbd-sample.res config file to match your
           settings. You have to change:

	   *) IP address of this host and the peer (address)
           *) GUID of the backing device (disk on windowshost)
	   *) Mount point (device)

	   If you rename this file, keep the .res extension. 

	*) To check the syntax, do

	   drbdadm dump windrbd-sample

	   (where windrbd-sample is the resource name)

	*) Then create metadata (from now on, everything as Administrator):

	   drbdadm create-md windrbd-sample

	*) Activate the device:

	   drbdadm up windrbd-sample

	*) Make it primary, so you can read/write it.

           drbdadm primary windrbd-sample

           This also creates the windrbd device to access the data
	   (note that this is one point where windrbd differs from
	    Linux DRBD). Your drive now should show up in the 
            Windows Explorer.

	*) To format the windrbd device, click format on the
	   panel that shows up. Be sure to select NTFS, others
           will not work.

	*) Get another Windows or Linux host, repeat the steps
           and watch them syncing. Be sure that the sizes of the
	   backing devices and meta-data settings (internal/external)
	   match on both hosts (this is a common reason for
	   connection failure, there are others).

	   Note that (older) Linux DRBD versions do not understand
           the windrbd disk and device syntax , so you have to fill in
	   dummy values (just copiing the file won't work). Or you
           upgrade your drbd-utils (under Linux) to 9.6.0 or newer.

           Also reconfigure Windows Firewall (unless turned off
           completly) to allow TCP/IP on the configured windrbd
	   ports.

	*) To uninstall WinDRBD, either use Uninstall WinDRBD in
	   the start menu or Windows Add/Remove Programs facility.

           Currently, to complete uninstall (to remove the driver)
	   a reboot is required (you will get prompted)

	*) Unless you want to keep it, delete the C:\windrbd folder also.

Thank you for participating in windrbd development.
