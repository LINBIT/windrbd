This is release 0.8.0-beta4 of windrbd. Do not use on production machines.
It is distributed in order to get feedback from testers, please email
bug reports directly to johannes@johannesthoma.com

We are of course also interested in:

	*) What works for you

	*) Performance numbers

	*) What else is on your wishlist (see restrictions)

	*) Which systems you used for testing

In order to get professional support for windrbd please contact
sales@linbit.com directly.

What currently works is:

	*) Connection between Linux/Windows or Windows/Windows

	*) NTFS and RAW backing devices

	*) Most drbdadm and drbdsetup commands.

	*) Internal or External metadata

	*) Many DRBD features like syncing, protocol A, B and C
	   on-line replication and diskless primary

	*) 3 node setups work but haven't been tested a lot. In
	   theory n-node setups (n<=32) should work.

Things that are known to be broken are:

	*) On backing device failure with ongoing I/O there are blue
	   screens (see TODO file in repo for more details).

	*) Network failure on n-node setups with m connected nodes (m>2)
	   setups.

	*) File systems other than NTFS

	*) Uninstall must be done manually (see end of this document)

Here are restrictions we know of for the 1.0 release:

	*) Auto-promote is not supported.

	*) System Volume (C:) cannot be used for windrbd.

	*) No 32-Bit version is supported, only 64 bit.

	*) Windows 7 is minimum (no Vista, no XP)

	*) Windows applications that use undocumented ioctl
	   system calls (like winsat).

Getting started:

	*) Make a snapshot of your Windows System (either using
           your favorite VM enviroment or something like CloneZilla).

	*) Run the install-windrbd-signed-0.8.0-beta4.exe file from the
	   Linbit Website as Administrator.

	*) After installation, reboot the machine

	*) You'll find the windrbd configuration files in the folder

	C:\windrbd\etc\drbd.d

	(note that they use the UNIX end-of-line character, you should
	 keep that).

        *) Start logging by following command (as Administrator):

	   windrbd log-server <filename>

	   Will log to the cmd window and to the file filename.
	   (note: to log via network change the ipaddress in the
	   registry:

Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\drbd\syslog_ip

           and reboot).

	   The target must either run windrbd log-server or be a
	   Linux host with UDP logging activated (see file INSTALL).
	   If it is a Linux host log messages usually go to
	   /var/log/syslog

	*) Create an empty partition using Control Panel (System/
	   Administration/Create and Format Partitions).
	   Do not format this partition, since it will be used as
	   backing device.

	*) You may assign a drive letter to the partition, however
	   we recommend not to do that and instead use the GUID of
           the partition. Use mountvol utility to find that GUID.

	*) Adapt the windrbd-sample.res config file to match your
           settings. You have to change:

	   *) IP address of this host and the peer (address)
           *) GUID of the backing device (disk on windowshost)
	   *) Mount point (device)

	   If you rename this file, keep the .res extension. 

	*) To check the syntax, do

	   drbdadm dump windrbd-sample

	   (where windrbd-sample is the resource name)

	*) Then create metadata (from now on, everything as Administrator):

	   drbdadm create-md windrbd-sample

	*) Activate the device:

	   drbdadm up windrbd-sample

	*) Make it primary, so you can read/write it.

           drbdadm primary windrbd-sample

           This also creates the windrbd device to access the data
	   (note that this is one point where windrbd differs from
	    Linux DRBD). Your drive now should show up in the 
            Windows Explorer.

	*) To format the windrbd device, click format on the
	   panel that shows up. Be sure to select NTFS, others
           will not work.

	*) Get another Windows or Linux host, repeat the steps
           and watch them syncing. Be sure that the sizes of the
	   backing devices and meta-data settings (internal/external)
	   match on both hosts (this is a common reason for
	   connection failure, there are others).

	   Note that Linux DRBD does not understand the windrbd
	   disk and device syntax yet, so you have to fill in
	   dummy values (just copiing the file won't work).

           Also reconfigure Windows Firewall (unless turned off
           completly) to allow TCP/IP on the configured windrbd
	   ports.

Right now, to uninstall windrbd you have to do that manually:

	*) Run following command to remove the driver:

rundll32.exe setupapi.dll,InstallHinfSection DefaultUninstall 132 C:\Windows\inf\drbd.inf

	(you have to reboot to stop the driver)

	*) Delete the user space utilities:

del c:\Windows\System32\drbdadm.exe
del c:\Windows\System32\drbdsetup.exe
del c:\Windows\System32\drbdmeta.exe
del c:\Windows\System32\windrbd.exe

	*) Unless you have installed CygWin, also delete the Cygwin DLLs:

del c:\Windows\System32\cygwin1.dll
del c:\Windows\System32\cygbz2-1.dll

	*) Delete the registry entries:

	(Note: this should already be done when removing the driver,
         if not, do this:)

	Using regedit, delete everything under:

Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\drbd

	*) Delete the inf file:

del c:\Windows\inf\drbd.inf 

	*) Unless you want to keep it, delete the C:\windrbd folder also.

I promise a Windows compliant uninstall (via Add/Remove Programs) routine
for the next release ... ;) but on the other hand: you did a snapshot
before you installed windrbd, right?!

Thank you for participating in windrbd development.
