Hi Devin,

I've been working to fix some usability issues:

1) It shouldn't be as easy as before to access the backing device while
    it is used by windrbd. You can still format it underneath windrbd
    (just like in Linux DRBD), but you have to confirm twice. If you
    do behaviour is undefined. "Normal" formatting or accessing the
    device in any way should fail now.

2) Conversion of a Windows visible file system on the backing device
    ("NTFS" signature) to a windrbd backing device ("DRBD" signature)
    now happens automatically on attach. It is currently not converted
    back to NTFS, users have to do that manually (if one modifies
    the backing device even when windrbd is down changes will not
    be propagated to peers, same behaviour in Linux)

3) Mount point (drive letter for the time being, later I will add NTFS
    directories (if they are empty)) is now part of the device directive.

    Sample:

       device "K:" minor 5;

   Will create a drive K: for all users (not just for the current session).
   (should K: be a network share also, the network share wins over
   the windrbd device. There is currently no warning if it is a network
   share).

4) Improvments on various Error / Warning messages of drbd-utils
    in case user tries something dangerous.

As always, please try "unusual" things which I haven't thought of
(like passing "/dev/drbd5" as device name, this is something I am
catching) and test from the view point of a "normal" user (with basic
Windows admin skills but nothing else).

Thank you for your time, I am on vacation next week but will respond
to emails.

Best wishes

- Johannes
