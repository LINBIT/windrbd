What is WinDRBD?
================

WinDRBD is a port of Linbit's Distributed Replicated Block Device
Linux driver to Microsoft Windows. Technically it is a thin
emulation layer that maps Linux specific kernel API calls to the
Microsoft Windows NT Kernel API.

DRBD itself is used to build High Availability clusters by replicating
contents of one block device over a network to (up to 31) other nodes.

In order to get professional support for WinDRBD please contact
sales@linbit.com directly.

To learn how to use WinDRBD to create a 2-node HA cluster based
on Microsoft Windows, please read the enclosed tech guide.

Since WinDRBD is still beta, it should not be used in production
environments. Furthermore, it is highly recommended that you
make a full backup of your Windows Installation before installing
WinDRBD.

WinDRBD is Open Source and licensed under the GNU general public
license. To obtain the source code, please go to:

We'd love to get feedback, either over the github site or over
the DRBD user mailing list (drbd-user@lists.linbit.com, please
go to http://lists.linbit.com/mailman/listinfo/drbd-user to
subscribe).

Thank you for participating in WinDRBD development by using it.
