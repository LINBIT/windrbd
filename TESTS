invalidate remote loop without I/O

works (400 iterations)

-----------------------------------------
Mar 31 2020

disconnect connect and wait sync (while I/O)

works very well (80 iterations).

-----------------------------------------

I/O test over diskless boot device

Ran until Windows shut down (no license)

-----------------------------------------
Mar 26 2020

detach attach loop (without I/O, without connection)

works very well (800 iterations).

-----------------------------------------
Mar 26 2020

disconnect connect and wait sync (while I/O

works very well (130 iterations).

-----------------------------------------

detach attach waitsync loop on a disk device and a linux peer

attach stalls after 100 iterations (of detach attach loop)

-----------------------------------------
Mar 26 2020

up down loop on a disk device and a linux peer

works very well.

-----------------------------------------

Mar 26 2020

primary secondary loop on a disk device

secondary takes 30-60 seconds to complete. Reason is
that we get a SUPRISE_REMOVAL (need to unmount device
from user space).

Apart from that, everything ok

Write to NTFS while invalidating remote

Still stalling on sync start (after ~50 iterations).

-----------------------------------------

Mar 25 2020

Write to NTFS while connected

Ok (2 hours).

-----------------------------------------

Feb 20 2019

Write to NTFS while invalidating remote

Primary (5df5726): Server 2016 doing I/O over file system and invalidate-remote loop (15 seconds interval)
Secondary (0a978d0): Linux just being connected

After putting I/O:

vamp-2nodes role:Primary
  volume:1 disk:UpToDate
  wintestubuntu role:Secondary
    volume:1 replication:SyncSource peer-disk:Inconsistent

(without progress bar)
-----------------------------------------

Feb 20

Write to NTFS 

Primary (bc90bb1): Windows 10 phys machine doing I/O over file system
Secondary (5df5726): Windows 7 VM

Some resource leak (after about 1500 iterations) cannot
start new processes on Secondary. This seems to be
Windows 7 specific.

-----------------------------------------

Feb 19 - Feb 20

Write to NTFS while connecting / disconnecting

Primary (82df601): Server 2016 doing I/O over file system
Secondary (0a978d0): Linux doing up-down loop

Ran 20 hours (36382 iterations, 1.8 TB)

-----------------------------------------

Basic DRBD functionality on a Windows 7 without Service Pack 1

It works, but Windows fails to accept Linbit certificate. So,
requirement SP1 remains for the normal user (one has to 
manually disable driver signature enforcement on every boot,
just putting it into test mode by running bcdedit does not
work) Also not with fresh service pack 1.

Write to NTFS while connected (Windows Server 2016, Protocol C):

Nov 15 17:15 still running (3x 10950 iterations) now need it for something else.

Nov 21 15:00 still running (1x 67700 iterations) I guess it works now.
