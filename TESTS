Basic DRBD functionality on a Windows 7 without Service Pack 1

It works, but Windows fails to accept Linbit certificate. So,
requirement SP1 remains for the normal user (one has to 
manually disable driver signature enforcement on every boot,
just putting it into test mode by running bcdedit does not
work) Also not with fresh service pack 1.

Write to NTFS while connected (Windows Server 2016, Protocol C):

On windows side:

(start this 3 times paralell)
./write-fs-loop.sh

(while connected to peer).

Protocol C.

Nov 13 14:30 still running (3x 2750 iterations)
Nov 15 17:15 still running (3x 10950 iterations) now need it for something else.

Nov 21 15:00 still running (1x 67700 iterations) I guess it works now.

Ok, no BSOD.

Write to NTFS while not connected:

On windows (Windows Server 2016 kvm) side:

./write-fs-loop.sh

(while not connected to peer).

Connect/Disconnect without I/O

On Windows side:

./disconnect-connect-loop.sh

(with a connectable peer).

Should not BSOD (as it did on Server 2016 before 0a9512aeb).

Update: running for little more than 12 days now (67803 iterations).

On linux side:

./iptables-drop-dont-drop-loop.sh

On windows side:

./write-fs-loop.sh

Must sync while connected and never get stuck in NetworkFailure

	without errors (except memory leak)
