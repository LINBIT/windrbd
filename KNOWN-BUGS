Known bugs in 0.9.2
-------------------

Stability: BSODs on disonnecting (even when there is no I/O)

	About 0.1% of drbdadm disconnect can cause a BSOD. Low level
	task synchronization (wait_event_interruptible(), schedule()
	and the like) must be redesigned to fix this (BSOD is in
	schedule()).

Stability: Windows 7 only: resource leak then Secondary and I/O

	After approx. 3 hour of I/O on Primary when a Windows 7
	machine is Secondary and connected, no more processes
	can be started. It might also happen that another Windows
	driver (Intel networking driver) BSODs because of
	shortage on resources.

Stability: Machine lockup/BSOD when interrupting Sync on Secondary often

	On Windows 10 a watchdog BSOD happens, on other machines no
	more task scheduling is done (mouse might still move but
	else machine is locked).

	The reason is that in the DRBD code path when interrupting
	Sync, rcu_lock is taken recursively (which is valid in Linux)
	This case must be explicitly allows (by storing rcu_lock
	state in the task struct and not taking it again if it
	already taken by the task).
