Patches to submit upstream:

TODO: in drbd_sender.c: tl_mark_for_resend_by_connection() check for device invalid (might happen if something in receiver lags)
	This was an issue that caused a BSOD when there were lots of printk's

TODO: drbd_nl.c: send a Linux event on becoming secondary / primary
	This is a nice to have patch

TODO: drbd_transport_tcp.c: discuss about accessing sk fields directly

Done: In 3 node setups sometimes resources are stuck in Negotiating
