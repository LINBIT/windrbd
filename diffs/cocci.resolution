! manual: maybe cocci (I think ({ ... }) macros can be patched also with cocci)
! manual: maybe cocci (but only one spinlock ... fix that first)
	Also used in abort_local_transaction()
	Can inter-function flag passing patched by cocci?
! manual: ! (cocci cannot find type - maybe by _resource macro name?)
! manual: ! uhh ... best is probably manual but also cocci is possible ...
! manual: ! review: possible with cocci? probably not so most likely manual (or ULONG_PTR) or maybe this is manual (inter-function IRQ flags)
! remove: upstream? or cocci (unsigned -> unsigned int)
